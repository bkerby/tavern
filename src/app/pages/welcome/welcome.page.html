    <p>Tavern allows the users to start tabs immediately at whichever bar,<br>
      theyâ€™re currently at or going to. When ordering drinks, a bartender will<br>
      then be able to add drinks to the tab. Since this tab is integrated with<br>
      the application, a user can check what's been ordered, how much it was, and<br>
      the current total. Most importantly, the user can pay off the tab and leave<br>
      a tip through the application. There is no need for either the user<br>
      or the bartender to seek each other out for tab closure.</p>
